### What I learned

This was my first time developing with React. Because I have used Vue for my whole college career, I wanted to
try out something different. Therefore, I created this todo app. My experience with React is a lot messier than I expected, maybe
because writing a .vue page has a lot of less clutter and is more seperated than jsx, but it could also be me being an uber noob at React.
I am looking forward to creating more with React and trying out different types of project.
